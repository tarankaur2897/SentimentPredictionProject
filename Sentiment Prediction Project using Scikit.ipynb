      "Olivia Hampton arrives at the Dunraven family home as cataloger of their extensive library. What she doesn't expect is a broken carriage wheel on the way. Nor a young girl whose mind is clearly gone, an old man in need of care himself (and doesn&#8217;t quite seem all there in Olivia&#8217;s opinion). Furthermore, Marion Dunraven, the only sane one of the bunch and the one Olivia is inexplicable drawn to, seems captive to everyone in the dusty old house. More importantly, she doesn't expect to fall in love with Dunraven's daughter Marion.Can Olivia truly believe the stories of sadness and death that surround the house, or are they all just local neighborhood rumor?Was that carriage trouble just a coincidence or a supernatural sign to stay away? If she remains, will the Castle&#8217;s dark shadows take Olivia down with them or will she and Marion long enough to declare their love?Patty G. Henderson has created an atmospheric and intriguing story in her Gothic tale. I found this to be an enjoyable read, even if it isn&#8217;t my usual preferred genre. I think, with this tale, I got hooked on the old Gothic romantic style. So I think fans of the genre (and of lesbian romances) will enjoy it.\n",

      "This book is published by Amazon - so I was surprised at the clunky writing. The manuscript cried out for an editor who could have removed some of the cliches and the profusion of needless adjectives and adverbs. Of course, no editor could have breathed much life into the wooden characters and stilted dialogue - but that's another issue.The quality of the writing shows itself early when we learn that one character has &#34;dread etched on his face,&#34; and another &#34;burned with curiosity&#34; while a third has a mouth &#34;frozen in a crooked half smile&#34; and for a fourth, &#34;anger coursed through his body.&#34; A young girl writes in her diary that &#34;Virginie respects that which is haram or forbidden.&#34; Kind of the diarist to explain.I have to admit I did not get through this long slog set in Egypt in 1919 and 1940. The world is too full of good books to waste time on mediocre ones.\n"
